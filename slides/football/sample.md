## When to Use 3-4

**Best against:**
- Passing teams
- Spread offenses
- Mobile quarterbacks

**Avoid when:**
- Facing power running game
- Outmatched physically up front
- Young/inexperienced linebackers

---

## Key Coaching Points

1. **NT must be strong** - Anchor against double teams
2. **OLBs set edge** - Don't let RB outside
3. **ILBs read and react** - Downhill on run, drop on pass
4. **Communication is critical** - Call out blocking schemes

---

## Common 3-4 Blitzes

**Fire Zone:**
- One OLB drops, other rushes
- Creates 4-man rush with zone behind

**Double A-Gap:**
- Both ILBs blitz A-gaps
- Confuses protection

**Edge Pressure:**
- Both OLBs rush from outside
- Forces quick throw

---

## Practice Drills

**Today's focus:**

1. NT double team recognition
2. OLB edge setting
3. ILB gap fills
4. Blitz timing

**Full team:** 3-4 vs. scout team run plays
